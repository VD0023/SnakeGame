# Title: Snake Game Development Using Python

**Introduction:**
The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a growing snake, guiding it to eat food and avoid collisions with itself and the game boundaries. This project aims to develop a Snake Game using Python programming language, providing an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience.

**Project Overview:**
The Snake Game project involves implementing both an AI-controlled version and a manual version of the game. These versions demonstrate different gameplay experiences for the player. Let's discuss each version and its corresponding code in detail.

**AI-Controlled Snake Game:**
The first part of the project focuses on an AI-controlled Snake Game. The code utilizes a Python module called `snake.game` to set up the game configuration and choose a specific solver and game mode. This version demonstrates the implementation of an AI algorithm that controls the movements of the snake. The chosen solver and game mode determine the behavior of the AI snake within the game. The AI snake attempts to navigate the game board while making intelligent decisions to collect food and avoid collisions.

**Manual Snake Game:**
The second part of the project involves developing a manual version of the Snake Game. The provided Python code demonstrates the manual gameplay implementation. The player controls the snake's movements using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The objective is to guide the snake to eat food, accumulate points, and avoid collisions with itself and the game boundaries. The game provides visual feedback, including the display of the current score and the snake's movement on the game board.

**Dependencies and Libraries:**
Both versions of the Snake Game rely on various Python libraries and dependencies to enable graphical rendering, event handling, and game logic. These include `pygame` for graphics and event handling, along with other standard libraries such as `random` and `sys`.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, this project involves the development of the Snake Game using Python programming language. It encompasses two versions of the game: an AI-controlled version and a manual version. The AI-controlled version demonstrates the implementation of an intelligent solver that controls the snake's movements, while the manual version allows players to directly control the snake's actions. The project showcases the application of game development principles and provides an entertaining gaming experience. By extending the code and incorporating additional features, such as different game modes or advanced AI algorithms, the project can be further enhanced.
